# Traffic Sign Recognition

Traffic Sign Recognition model using TensorFlow/Keras for autonomous vehicles. This project aims to classify and recognize traffic signs in images, with applications in autonomous vehicles and traffic management systems.

## Usage
- Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/KannurAnudeepRaj/Traffic-Sign-Recognition.git
  ```

- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- Run the main script:
  ```bash
  python TrafficSignRecognition.py
  ```

## Project Setup Guide

### 1. Dataset
- Obtain a labeled dataset of traffic sign images. Ensure diversity in sign types, lighting, and perspectives.

### 2. Dependencies
- Install required Python libraries using:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### 3. Model Training
- Adjust hyperparameters and model architecture in `TrafficSignRecognition.py`.
- Run the script for training and evaluation.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate the trained model on test data to measure accuracy and performance.

### 5. Usage and Deployment
- Integrate the model into your autonomous vehicle system or traffic management application.
